<h2>Light Calculator</h2>
<h4>My first flutter project :)</h4>
<p>A simple and beautiful calculator app.</p>
<p>
  UI adapted from 
  <a href="https://github.com/JohannesMilke/calculator_ui_example">@JohannesMilke</a> 
  and it has been slightly improved and real functionality has been added to app.
